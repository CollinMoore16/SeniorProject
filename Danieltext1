Hi, my name is Daniel Harris-Jordan, and I am a mmeber of this team for our senior project. Not much has been done yet, however we have been bouncing ideas around on what our project will be and about how we will divide the work. All I have done so far is give my input on ideas, as well as adding information to our shared slideshow. I added extra content and improved on the ideas that were already there.
