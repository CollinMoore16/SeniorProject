Hello my name is Collin Moore and for this project I have been selected 
as team leader for my team! I will be in charge of managing the group, 
contributing to code, and making sure everything goes smoothly. As of now
we are in the setup phase and have notdedicated jobs yet.

Built the Mock API for add card as we did not have access to our database yet.
when we do have access I will then link with database so that cards that are
added in using the API will go directly into the database.
